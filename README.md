This is the start of a new project to map concepts on wikipedia found in a school curriculum into a 
hierarchy of related concepts, based on relatedness, information entropy, etc.

The first step in this process is to webcrawl and extract relevant links with n degrees of freedom, starting 
from a node (website link).  I will need to come up with an algorithm for extracting relevant links.

The second step is to use relational data, info entropy metrics, or some other algorithm in order to determine
relatedness of two concepts, and which one is higher in the hierarchy.

The third step is to somehow map this into a graphical interface where the user can explore relevant concepts based on 
a list of concepts.
